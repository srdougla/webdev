# First Project Statement: Website Development
Overview:
For this project, youâ€™re encouraged to work in pairs(If you prefer to work alone or in a group of three, just ask for approval) to create a multi-page informational website on a topic of your choice. This could be related to your hobbies, travel experiences, a favorite book or movie, a business idea, or any subject that interests you. Your goal is to design and build a structured and visually appealing website using HTML and CSS and publish it online.

Project Requirements
Your website should consist of at least three linked pages and demonstrate the following concepts learned in the first five weeks:

HTML Structure & Elements 

Use semantic HTML to structure your pages properly (header, footer, article, section, nav).
Include headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and at least one table or multimedia element (audio/video).
CSS Styling

Apply color schemes, background styling, and typography choices that enhance readability.
Style lists, tables, and text properties appropriately.
Implement spacing techniques (margin, padding, borders) for a well-organized layout.
CSS Layout & Responsiveness

Use Flexbox for structuring sections or aligning content.
Include at least one media query to ensure your site adapts to different screen sizes.
Publishing Your Website

Your final project must be published using GitHub Pages or your UVM domain.
Submit a link to your published site along with the source code repository.
Collaboration Guidelines
This is a group project. You may work individually upon approval of the instructor.
If working in pairs:
Clearly divide tasks (e.g., one person focuses on HTML structure while the other styles with CSS).
Use GitHub collaboration tools (branching, pull requests, issues) to track progress.
Both members must contribute equally and will be asked to submit a brief reflection on their contributions.
Suggested Topics
Hobbies & Interests (e.g., photography, music, gaming, painting, fitness)
Travel & Tourism (e.g., favorite destinations, travel guides, local attractions)
Business & Markets (e.g., a startup idea, product showcase, small business website)
Education & Learning (e.g., coding tutorials, language learning resources)
Personal Portfolio (e.g., about me, projects, resume, skills)
Submission Requirements
Submit a zipped folder containing all project files (.html, .css, and media assets) 
The homepage should be named index.html.
Include a README.md or readme.txt file explaining the purpose of your website and listing the key features.
Provide a link to your published website on GitHub Pages or your UVM domain.
Provide a GitHub repository link if published in GitHub
If working in pairs, submit a collaboration report (1-2 paragraphs) outlining individual contributions.
